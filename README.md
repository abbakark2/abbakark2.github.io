## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/abbakark2.github.io.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd abbakark2.github.io
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**: You can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the portfolio.

4. **Assets**: Ensure that the `assets` folder contains the necessary images:
   - `sadik_portrait.jpg` for your profile picture.
   - Images in the `project-images` folder for the respective projects.

## Implemented Suggestions

- **Profile Picture Update**: The placeholder image in the "About Me" section has been replaced with `sadik_portrait.jpg`.
- **Project Images Update**: The placeholder images in the "Projects Section" have been updated with the corresponding images from the `project-images` folder.

## Remaining Suggestions for Improvement

1. **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags for description and keywords in the `<head>` section of `index.html` to improve search engine visibility.
2. **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes for better accessibility.
3. **Responsive Design Enhancements**: Test the portfolio on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks good everywhere.
4. **Additional Sections**: Consider adding sections for testimonials, a blog, or a downloadable resume to provide more information about your skills and experiences.
5. **Social Media Links**: Include links to your professional social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.) in the footer or header for better networking opportunities.
6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize images for faster loading times and consider using lazy loading for images that are not immediately visible on the screen.
